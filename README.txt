This is a fully GPL compliant version of the GZDoom engine, which in turn is
based on the ZDoom engine, which in turn is based on id Software's Doom engine.
All of the code from Doom has been relicensed from the Doom Software License to
the GPL license, and all legally troubled code (such as the code taken from
Ken Silverman's BUILD engine) have been either removed or rewritten and
licensed to be GPL compatible.
