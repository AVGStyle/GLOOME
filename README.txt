WHAT IS GLOOME:

GLOOME is a commercial-friendly GPL-compliant rebrand of the GZDoom engine,
which is based on the ZDoom engine, which in turn is based on id Software's
Doom engine. It's a little bit incestuous.

All of the code from Doom has been relicensed from the Doom Software License to
the GPL license, and all legally troubled code (such as the code taken from
Ken Silverman's BUILD engine) have been either removed or rewritten and
licensed to be GPL compatible.

**********************

GLOOME GITHUB:

https://github.com/marrub--/GLOOME/

All of the GLOOME source code is stored here, free for anyone to look at,
persue, fork, or modify for their own purposes, as per GPL requirements.

WHY GLOOME:

There's been a lot of discussion as of time of this writing about the viability
of using Doom source ports to create full-fledged indie games. A lot of people
have come out with some astounding projects; massive mapsets, complete gameplay
overhauls, redone graphics, etc.
But every now and then, there's a project that's completely unlike Doom at all,
to the point where people say it would be better as its own thing, rather than
a "mod". And sometimes these discussions just kind of ... end with the usual
question marks.

Is it possible to do this? Can mods really become standalone games? Would it
even be feasible to undertake all the work for a small community? What draws
the line between an extremely in-depth "mod" and a fully standalone "game"?
Wouldn't we still need to have a doom2.wad to run? If we still have ties to
Doom, won't that cause legal issues? What would Carmack do?

This fork hopes to address these issues. As mentioned before, all of the
licensed code has been rewritten. All of the legally-questionable code has been
plucked out and replaced with either more legally-compliant code or outright
rewritten. The engine itself is completely open-source and free for anyone to
modify, adjust, distribute, or whatever as they please.

With this, we now have an engine where someone can make a completely new
not-Doom game with and distribute among other sites, like RPG Maker was to
Yume Nikki or Cherry Tree High Comedy Club.

Someone completely unfamiliar with Doom, the Doom modding scene, or anything at
all can just download a game, fire up the .exe, and play it without needing any
know-how or "drag this .pk3 onto this .exe" or "load up multiple files" or
"DON'T PUT IT IN YOUR SKINS FOLDER FOR THE LOVE OF GOD". If somebody wanted to
make a full-fledged indie first-person-shooter, they can use this engine to
create a slew of new maps, new enemies, new levels, new items, new weapons, and
more, and then throw it up on Steam without worrying about Doom copyrights.

CREDITS:

John Carmack
- The forefather of everything. Not just Doom, but for his incredible
generosity and astounding contributions to the video game industry. Without
his work, we would not be where we are now. The entire scene would be a wildly
different place.
Thank you, Carmack.

Randy Heit and Christoph Oelckers
- Creating ZDoom and GZDoom, of which, of course, this is based on (and where
at least 99% of the code comes from). Being amazing programmers and keeping
up with a source port for 20 or so years. Without these people, this port would
have not even been a thought.

JP LeBreton
- Project lead of DECK, one of the big motivators/inspirations behind GLOOME.

marrub
- Did pretty much everything else.

TerminusEst13
- Project director.
